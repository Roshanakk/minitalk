<h2>Using Unix Signals ! ðŸ“¡</h2>

<h3>About</h3>

This is a server/client system that uses UNIX signals for communication. 
<br>
The server displays its PID and receives decrypted signals as characters, while the client encrypts messages and sends true/false signals using SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 to the server's PID.
